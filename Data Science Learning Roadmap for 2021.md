- What is learning roadmap?
**An extension of a curriculum**
It charts out a multi-level skills map with details about **what** skills you want to hone, **how** you will measure the outcome at each level, and **techniques** to further master each skill.
[My roadmap](https://www-freecodecamp-org.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/www.freecodecamp.org/news/data-science-learning-roadmap/amp/) assigns weights to each level based on complexity and commonality of its application in the real-world. Estimated time for a beginner to complete each level with exercises and projects
-  Data science tasks in order of complexity, complexity decreases and common usage increase as you go down.
-  Things to complete to become a data scientist
	- [[Deep Learning]]
	- [[ML(algo) Engineering]]
	- [[Applied Statistics and Experiment design]]
	- [[EDA & Storytelling]]
	- [[Data extraction and wrangling]]
	- [[Programming]]
- We'll have to deep dive into each of these strata to complete our framework with more specific measurable details.
- We'd be able to measure he knowledge gained by applying the learned topics to a number of real-world projects]]. I've added a few [[projects ideas, portals, and platforms that you can use to measure your proficiency.
- ==Take it one day at at time, one video/blog/chapter a day. It is wide spectrum to cover. Don't overwhelm yourself!==
- Track your learning process
