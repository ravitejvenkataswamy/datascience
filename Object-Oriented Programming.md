- All values are objects in python
- A method for organising [[modular programs]]
    - [[Data abstraction]] barriers
    - Building together information and related behaviour
- A metaphor for computation using distributed state
    - Each object has its own local state.
    - Each object also knows how to manage its own local state, based on method calls.
        - If you call method on object, that might change its state and object knows how to update it correclty
    - Method calls are passed between objects.
    - Several objects may all be instance of a common type
    - __Specialized syntax & vocabulary to support this metaphor__
