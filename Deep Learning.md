- ## How to Learn About Machine Learning and AI
	- (Estimated time: 4-5 months)
	- Now you can get started with the fancy [[machine learning]] alogrithms
	- There are 3 major types of learning:
	   [[Supervised Learning]]
	   [[Unsupervised Learning]]
	  [[Reinforcement learning]]
	- ==The majority of the [[machine learning]] projects need you to master a number of tasks that I've explained in this [blog](https://towardsdatascience.com/task-cheatsheet-for-almost-every-machine-learning-project-d0946861c6d0)==
- ### Resources to learn about [[machine learning]]
	- Here's a free full course on [Machine learning in python with ScikitLearn](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/machine-learning-with-scikit-learn-full-course/) on the freeCodeCamp.org [[YouTube]] channel. ^5e103d
	- [ ]  [[books]] [Hands-On Machine learning with Scikit-learn, Keras, and TensorFlow, 2nd Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-Learn-TensorFlow/dp/1492032646/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=Hands-On+Machine+Learning+with+Scikit-Learn%2C+Keras%2C+and+TensorFlow%2C+2nd+Edition&qid=1610253356&sr=8-1) --==one of my all-time favourite books on machine learning. Doesn't only cover the theoretical mathematical derivations, but also showcase the implementation of algorithms through examples. You should solve the exercise given at the end of each chapter== .
	-  [Machine Learning Course by Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) ==--the go-to course for anyone trying to learn machine learning. Hands down!==
	- [Introduction to Machine learning](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-machine-learning) -- Intereative course by [[Kaggle]]
	-  [Intro to Game AI and Reinforcement Learning ](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-game-ai-and-reinforcement-learning) -- another interactive course on [[Kaggle]] on reinforcement learning.
- ### [Deep learning Specialization by deep learning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/deep-learning-specialization/)
	- for those of you who are interested in further diving into deep learning, you can start off by completing this specialisation offered by [[deeplearning.ai]] and the Hands-On book. This is not as important form a data science perspective unless you are planning to solve a computer vision or NLP problem
	- Deep learning deserves a dedicated roadmap of its own. I'll create that with all the fundamental concepts soon.
