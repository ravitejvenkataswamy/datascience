#### [[Relative description]] 
- often compared to family trees
- Descriibing all of the trees with in a tree often invalues the term [[node]]
- Each location or position in a tree is called node
##### Node
- Node is always another tree itself
- But, when using the notation [[node]] it's not interesting to think about the sub-trees, but instead their *relative*(hence the name) locations to other nodes
-  Each node has a label and each node also has a configuration relative to another nodes.
- ![[Tree Abs (reviw).excalidraw]]
- 3 is the parent of 2
- 2 is the child of 3
- *People often refer to labels by their locations: "each parent is the sum of its children"*
	- instead of saying the node with label 2 is thechild of the node label 3
	- People just say 2 is the child of 3
	- Node are ones that are having the relationships, labels are just numbersi
##### Path:
- a path is sequence of nodes where each element is either the parent or child or previous node they are connect in a tree diagram.
- The most common paths a paths are form leaf to root.
