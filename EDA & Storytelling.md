- ## How to Learn About Exploratory Data Analysis, Business Acumen, and Storytelling
    - (Estimated time: 2-3 months)
    - the next stratum to master is data analysis and [[storytelling]]. Drawing insights form the data and then communicating the same to management in simple terms and visualisations is the core responsibility of a [[Data Analyst]].
    - The storytelling part requires you to be proficient with data visualisation along with excellent [[communication]] skills
- ### Specific exploratory data analysis and storytelling topics to learn include:
    - Exploratory data analysis -- defining questions, handling missing values, outliers, formatting, filtering, univariate and multivariate analysis.
    - Data visulisation -- plotting data using libraries like matplotlib, seaboard, and plotly. Know how to choose the right chart to communicate the findings from the data.
    - Developing dashboards -- a good percent of analysts only use Excel or a specialised tool like Power BI and Tableau to build dashboards that summarise/aggregate data to help management make decisions.
    - Business acumen: Work on asking the right questions to answer, ones that actually target the business metics. Practice writing clear and concise reposts, blogs, and presentations.
