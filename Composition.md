# Composition
#inprogress 
## From previous mentions
- from [[Inheritance]]
- What's composition? ^860264
	- One object has another [[object]] as an [[attribute]]
	This also a very common pattern as well, just like a inheritance ^bf048a
	
## From Lecture 21
### [[Linked Lists]]
- Learn how to implement them using python's objects system

### 	[[Linked List Processing]]
- [[Recursion]] is very common in [[Linked List Processing|linked list processing]] when constructing new [[Linked Lists|linked list]] or taking an existing linked list and doing something with it.
- We can ==NOT== use built-in functions like [[range]], [[map]] and [[filter]] for Linked Lists, because there are user defined
- So, if we want to have the same functionality of [[range]], [[map]] and [[filter]] we implement it for linked lists

### [[Linked List Mutation]]
- a Linked list instance is an object, all instances of a user-defined class can be changed or mutation
- Lets have a look

### [[Tree Class]]
- Another recursive computational data structure is the tree

### [[Tree Mutation]]
- Where we actually change the tree instance
