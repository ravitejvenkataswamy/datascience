- ### How to learn about Programming or Software Engineering(Estimated 2-3 )
	- First, I should have sound programming skills.
	Every Data Science job description will ask for programming expertise in at least one languages
- #### Specific programming topics to know include:
    - Common [[data structures]] (data types, lists, dictionaries, sets, tuples), writing functions, [[logic]], control flow, [[searching algorithms]] and [[sorting algorithms]], [[Object-Oriented Programming]], and working with [[external libraries]].
    - [[SQL]] scripting: Querying [[databases]] using joins, aggregations, and subqueries
    - Comfort using the [[Terminal]], version control in [[Git]], and using [[GitHub]]
- #### Resources to learn Python:
    - [Learnpython.org](Learnpython.org)[Free] 
    - I am learning [[CS61A]] from UC Berkeley 
    - [[books]] [[Zed Shawâ€™s Learn Python 3 the Hard Way]]
    - [[Kaggle]] [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python) [free] - a free and interactive guide to learning python. It is a short tutorial covering all the important topics for data science 
    - Python certifications on [[freeCodeCamp.org]][free] - freeCodeCamp offers several certifications based on Python, such as scientific computing, data analytics, and machine learning.
    - Python course by freeCodeCamp.org on [[YouTube]]

    - Intermediate Python [Link](https://www.YouTube.com/watch?v=HGOBQPFzWKo) - Another free course by Patrick featured on freeCodeCamp.org from [[YouTube]]
    - Coursera Python for Everybody Specialization[fee] from Michigan 
- #### Resources for learning Git and GitHub
    - Guide for [Git](https://www.atlassian.com/git) and [GitHub](https://lab.github.com/) [free]: Complete these tutorials and labs to develop a firm grip over version control. It  will help you further in contributing to open-source projects.
    - Here's a [Git and GitHub crash course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/git-and-github-crash-course/) on the freeCodeCamp.org [[YouTube]] channel
- #### Resources for Learning SQL
    - Here's a course on [SQL and Database](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/sql-and-databases-full-course/) on freeCodeCamp.org [[YouTube]] channel
    - [Intro to SQL](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-sql) and [Advanced SQL](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/advanced-sql) on [[Kaggle]]
    - Treehouse offers a [good introductory SQL course here.](https://teamtreehouse.com/tracks/beginning-sql)
- #### ==Measure your expertise by solving a lot of problems and building at least 2 projects==
-  [ ] Solve a lot of problems here: [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)(beginner-friendly) and [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) (solve easy or medium-level quesions)  [[LeetCode]] [[HackerRank]]

	 - [ ] Data Extraction form a website/API endpoints -- try to write python scripts from extracting data from webpages that allow scrapping like [soundcloud.com](soundcloud.com.md) store the extracted data into a CSV file or SQL database

	- [ ] Games like rock-paper-scissor, spin a yarn, hangman, dice rolling simulator, tic-tac-toe, and so on.

	- [ ] Simple web apps like a YouTube Video downloader, website blocker, music player, plagiarism checker, and so on.

	- [ ] Deploy these projects on GitHub pages or simply host the code on GitHub so that you learn to use Git
